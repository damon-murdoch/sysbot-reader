# Sysbot Reader
## A program for reading sysbot commands written to a list of given twitch channels
### Developed by Damon Murdoch ([@SirScrubbington](https://twitter.com/SirScrubbington)).

## Introduction
A program for reading sysbot commands written to a list of given twitch channels. Requires
an API key, a valid user account key and a list of twitch channels to view the chat. Several
other features can be customised. Saves the results to a local sqlite database. 

I originally had this repository hidden as I did not want it to be misused, however
other projects of this nature have been made public so I no longer feel the need to
do so.
